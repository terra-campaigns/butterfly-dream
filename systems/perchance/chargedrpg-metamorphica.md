It takes several moments to inflate, and will be of little use mitigating the effects of short falls, but can be inflated in time to prevent death from falls greater than a hundred feet (30m). The gas bag does not provide any way to move through the air, and the mutant may be at the mercy of wind currents.

  Lucid Dreaming
    def = This mutant is aware when it is dreaming, always retains full knowledge of its own identity when dreaming, and can enter a dream-state while awake, without any apparent lapse in consciousness. This gives it a much greater ability to tell what is real apart from what is unreal. Mind-altering drugs, illusions, psychic intrusion, and mind control have a much lower rate of effectiveness against this mutant.
  Mechanical Intuition

  Mindless
    def = This mutant is a mindless automata, incapable of even the simplest thoughts.

  Familiarity
    def = This mutant psychically influences strangers it meets to think they have met before and are at least vaguely familiar with each other.

Only later will a target realize that they had not, in fact, met the mutant before. 
  Fire in the Head
    def = This mutant can put a mental “fire” into the mind of another individual, causing them to suffer great pain and confusion.

    def = This mutant is able to psychically alter the characteristics of nearby light, causing fluctuations in brightness and colour, and causing some items to become more or less visible, depending on how light waves move around and over them. These effects require concentration, and the mutant must be able to see or sense the light affected.
  Magnetic Control
    def = This mutant can sense and manipulate magnetic fields to repel, attract, or manipulate ferrous objects and other materials affected by such fields.<br>Precision: [magcon1]<br>Range: [magcon2]<br>Strength: [magcon3]

    def = This mutant can create a subconscious mental link between those it touches. Everyone involved in this link will find their biological and mental rhythms synching up, and may use any psychic power that any of the others possesses, and that power’s strength is proportionately increased by the number of individuals so linked (doubled by a link between two individuals, tripled by a link between three, etc).

    def = This mutant can project a blast of harmful and disorienting psychic energy.<br>Range: [menbla]
  Mental Suggestion
    def = This mutant is able to implant commands into the minds of others with whom it communicates.

  Animal Shapechange
    def = This mutant may assume the form of another animal, and can move around and act as if it were that animal. The mutant does not gain any special powers or mutations, and each animal form is unique—the mutant cannot mimic specific animals. This takes several seconds of concentration and a great deal of energy to perform, so the mutant may be exhausted and hungry when it transforms back.

  Astral Projection
    def = This mutant can project its conscious spirit out of its body, through space and into other planes of existence.

  Book-Viewing
    def = This mutant can read what is written in any book in existence, simply by looking in another book of a similar type.

The mutant cannot see the pages of books that have been destroyed, and the mutant must know what book it wishes to look at. 
  Brain Washer
    def = This mutant can alter the brain chemistry of a captive person. Over the course of several days, weeks, or months—depending on how many changes the mutant is making—the target’s mind is erased, reshaped, and reprogrammed. Small changes require days, deeplyingrained and cultural traits take weeks to change, and completely altering a person’s identity and memories takes months. This requires constant supervision, but the mutant may employ subordinates for basic tasks. The stronger the target’s will, the harder the process is and the more chance it can be reversed, given time.
  Breath Weapon
    def = This mutant can spew a hazardous substance from its mouth.<br>Frequency: [brewea1]<br>Type: [brewea2]

    def = This mutant can make or break someone else’s reputation. Simply by meeting with the target, the mutant can apply the reputation of its choice to them, and for as long as it wishes, this new reputation, good or bad, follows the target wherever they go. The mutant can only affect one target at a time, and once its influence is removed, the target’s reputation is left in their hands, though any false accusations are easily uncovered for what they are.

If this mutant is subject to multiple simultaneous or immediately subsequent attacks, it only reflects half the effects of the second attack, a third of the effects of the third attack, a fourth of the effects of the fourth attack, and so on.

  Liquid Form
    def = This mutant can become liquid, transforming its normally solid body into a plasmoid, malleable form that moves as the mutant wishes.

  Magic Resistance
    def = This mutant has an innate resistance to magic, which is ineffective [1d6+4]×10 per cent of the time. This applies to all magic used against the mutant directly, not physical effects caused by magic directed at other targets.
  Magnetic
    def = This mutant is unusually magnetic, and light-weight metallic objects will stick to its skin.
  Manikin
    def = In place of a face, this mutant has either a miniature replica of its own upper body, including torso, arms, and what its face should look like, or the upper body of some other creature.

    def = This mutant has gills, fins, scales, and a fish tail or tentacles instead of legs. It is adapted for living underwater, not on land.

  Mind Cannibal
    def = When this mutant devours the blood, bones, or flesh of another individual, it gains some of their knowledge, memories, and, if they have any, psychic powers. Memories can be gained even through drops of blood, but significant abilities require the whole body be consumed.
  Molecular Disruption
    def = This mutant can disrupt the molecules of a solid mass, causing it to fall apart. This takes an extraordinary amount of energy, and the mutant needs rest and food when done.

  Molecular Sense
    def = This mutant can sense the exact molecular composition of anything in range.<br>Range: [molsen]

  Mutant Detection
    def = This mutant can detect the presence of other mutants within range, and can tell if anyone within range is a mutant or not.<br>Range: [mutdet]

  No Shadow
    def = This mutant does not cast a shadow. Light appears to pass right through it, and be reflected by it at the same time. Anyone studying this phenomenon with powerful, hi-tech sensors will probably go insane and try to build a machine that destroys life.
  Object Bound
    def = This mutant’s soul is located in some physical object. Harming the object harms the mutant, and possessing it gives power over the mutant.
  Object Mimic
    def = This mutant can reshape its body to mimic any common, mundane immobile object. The mutant may not move in this form but retains 1d4 senses and may change back at any time.<br>Max Size: [objmim1]<br>Min Size: [objmim2]
  Patronage
    def = This mutant is somehow in tune with one of the gods of chaos, who shows favour to it.

  Spirit Medium

  Stigmata
    def = This mutant is prone to bleeding through its skin, without having wounds.<br>Location: [stig]

  Werecreature
    def = This mutant changes shape at certain times, having two different shapes that it switches between. For its second form, roll twice on the creature table and either combine them or choose the more dangerous result. There is a 1 in 3 chance this form is anthropomorphic.<br>Trigger: [were]

  Zone of Silence
    def = This mutant can stop the production and distribution of sound within its presence.<br>AoE: [zonsil1]<br>Trigger: [zonsil2]<br>Sounds: [zonsil3]
