    poundQuestion = What was your speciality?
    poundAnswer
      Judge: You can pronounce sentences on guilty captives. This only works if the target is (a) helpless and  restrained, (b) guilty of a crime, according to one of your definitions, and (c) able to understand you. You  name a prohibited action, and the target will henceforth never perform the action willingly.
      Bailiff: You gain a set of manacles. For you, slapping a manacle on a limbed creature is as easy as touching  its wrist or ankle.
      Interrogator: Gain a interrogation box, about a metre in each dimension. It has a large acoustic horn  flaring from the top. If a person or animal is placed inside it, all speech is translated as it passes into or out  of the horn.
      Cat Catcher: You can speak the language of cats and other felines.
      Dog Catcher: You can speak the language of dogs and other canines.

The effect is ruined if they see visible proof of the passage's functionality.
      Truancy: You gain a "No Loitering" sign. If hung on a wall, subtle psychic emanations cause creatures toavoid the location, instead preferring to hang out somewhere else.
      Unlawful Construction: You gain an "Out of Order" sign. Anything that you hang it on becomesnonfunctional for as long as the sign remains.
      Legal Counsel: You gain a pocket lawyer, a tiny man who lives in your pocket. He is extremelyknowledgeable on all forms of law. His diet is composed of mealworms and tea. He attempts to escape ifexposed to a library.
