## Export permits

Leonti Vites, a financier of the Adventure Bank, goes to the Hegemony Capital to rent the debt of many failed Servitor caste workers.
Amongst them, Ferno, Juão and Pierro.

Leonti explains he will bring them to the north, where they can find caravan work, get rich, and pay the fee for an import license back home.
That fee will be £ 3.500 each.
He also lent € 1.000 each, so they can set their caravan.
In November, they need to repay that loan with 100% interests.

They fly north on a Zepellin.
The craft flies for two days, and crosses mountainous sea, volcanos to the east and deserts.
It avoids the west due to the presence of hostile barbarians.
Arriving in the Violet City, a purple haze covers the west.
