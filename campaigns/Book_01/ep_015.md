## Travel with Pumas

[Drake](directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Razzy](directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) and [Yarrow](directory/Sigisfarne/Yarrow.md) leave [Sigisfarne](directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) and travel north towards the [Rabbit's Inn](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md).
[Oswin](directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md) would come too, but he is delayed.
The day is bright and inviting for adventuring.
As they travel, Razzie feels happy about hitting the road again.

Yarrow tells the story of his arrest warrant:
In the town in the south, she won a competition of corpse flowers.
But because he learned special methods from wood creatures, her flowers were different.
And they ate a lord.

Half a day later, the group is chased by Pumas.
The animals never attack, but the journey is made much longer.

## Eating and drinking

The group arrives at the Inn late.
Martha and Earnest receive them well, especially when they learn the group is here to help with their rabbits being eaten by some burrowing creature.
The group is served plenty of rabbit stew.

Earnest sits with them and offers drinks before bed.
Yarrow is suspicious and does not drink.
Neither does Earnest.
The others do, and become very dizzy.

## Ambush

At night, a creature made of bark, in Earnest's body, comes to Razzie's bedroom.
His bright red eyes start to turn her into a rabbit: "Look deep in my mind!"
With her scream, Yarrow wakes up first and comes to her room.
She attacks the creature, but she retreats when she feels her body changing into a rabbit.

Drake wakes up and comes to join the fight.
He sees Yarrow, with the head of a rabbit.
Razzie's room is empty, beyond a small bunny.
The creature left through the window.

Martha meets the group in the hall.
Unable to explain what is happening, Drake shoots her down.
When her body falls, she is much older.

The group goes and checks for the daughters.
They are found in their bedroom and are scared of the weapons.
Finally, Oswin catches up with the group and arrives late at night at the Inn.

## Prisoners

Drake and Oswin track the creature to the barn.
Drake shoots it and, after a skirmish, can kill it.

The daughters return to their original form; they are now grown-up women.
The rabbits in the barn are human prisoners.
An old couple are [Hilda](directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md)'s parents.

The group helps the survivors in recovery.
Hilda's parents and the two daughters will now take care of the Inn.
