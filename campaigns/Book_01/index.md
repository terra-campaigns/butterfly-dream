People settle in villages and towns.  
They bring order to their lives and surroundings.  
Strict hierarchy and rules apply.  
This pleases the ***Law***.

Dark places spread and fold and coil unto themselves.  
Like an ever-growing virus.  
They make the impermanent.  
This pleases ***Chaos***.

***Law*** and ***Chaos*** hate each other destructively.  
They can only act on their hate through their acolytes.

You led an everyday life.  
Not anymore.  
You are now ***unsettled***.

## Travel procedures

A **Hex** takes a **Watch** to cross.  
A **Barrier** cannot be crossed normally, unless with specific knowledge of a pass.
Through a pass, crossing a **Barrier** takes a **Watch**.  
Travelling through well maintained roads, or downriver, doubles the speed.

**Barriers** and **Landmarks** are not normally presented on the map.
If someone attempts to travel out of a **Hex** through a **Barrier**, they are not able to, but still spend the time.
Exploring a **Hex** takes a **Watch** and presents all its **Landmarks** and **Barriers**, if any.

For each **Watch** roll a die.
Normally ***d6***.
You may also roll for **Dire Weather** and **Low Visibility**.

| ***4+***  | Find the Hex's Landmark<br>(not when camping);<br>otherwise, it is all clear. | Fine weather.                                                               | Normal progress.              |

If ***2-3*** is rolled twice in a row, treat it as a ***1***.  

## Trade

Not all items are available at the GM's discretion in every settlement.
Used gear is worth half of its regular price.
Selling treasure may trigger inflation in a settlement, which halves selling prices.
When inflation is triggered, it lasts 2d6 weeks.

- **Village**: Inflation is triggered at 1d6 x 100 gp. The absolute trade limit is 600 gp.
- **Town**: Inflation is triggered at 1d20 x 100 gp. The absolute trade limit is 2000 gp.
- **City**: Inflation is triggered at 1d6 x 1000 gp. The absolute trade limit is 6000 gp.
