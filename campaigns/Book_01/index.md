People settle in villages and towns.  
They bring order to their lives and surroundings.  
Strict hierarchy and rules apply.  
This pleases ***Law***.

Dark places spread and fold and coil unto themselves.  
Like an ever-growing virus.  
They make the impermanent.  
This pleases ***Chaos***.

***Law*** and ***Chaos*** hate each other destructively.  
They can only act on their hate through their acolytes.

You led an everyday life.  
Not anymore.  
You are now ***unsettled***.

### Travel procedures

Wilderness dice will be based on the chance of an event: d6 < d8 < d10 < d12 < d20.  
A result of 7+ indicates **no events**.

### Trade

Not all items are available in every settlement, at the GM's discretion.
Used gear is worth half of its regular price.
Selling treasure may trigger inflation in a settlement, which halves selling prices.
When inflation is triggered, it lasts 2d6 weeks.

- **Village**: Inflation is triggered at 1d6 x 100 gp. The absolute trade limit is 600 gp.
- **Town**: Inflation is triggered at 1d20 x 100 gp. The absolute trade limit is 2000 gp.
- **City**: Inflation is triggered at 1d6 x 1000 gp. The absolute trade limit is 6000 gp.
