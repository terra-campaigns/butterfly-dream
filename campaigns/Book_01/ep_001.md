## The ruined church

Young Clive, playing teenage games, enters the [abandoned church](../../directory/Sigisfarne/RuinedChurch.md) in [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md)'s heart.

Despite being in the middle of the village, the place has been closed for many generations. Many say it is older than the village, which is already ancient.

The villagers take straws, and a group of five is tasked with going into the church to find the teenagers:  [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Adair](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Adair.md), [Yewtree](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md), [Flint](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Flint.md) and [Rushd](../../directory/Sigisfarne/RushdIbnUbada.md). 
## An old belief

They go through the hole on the side of the iron gate. The entire construction is made of massive stone blocks, which were talentedly assembled.

Broken stone floor, an altar with symbols of our own religion, the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md). Why isnâ€™t this church adopted by our priests?

Decrepit furniture with runic scratching and scaffolding on one of the sides of the building is found. A set of 3 keys is found: the front wooden door and iron gate can be opened. The keys look ancient.

The stairs up are very worn. The church bell lies on the floor, where raptors make a nest. Meanwhile, Razzie found a silvery feather that now adorns her hair.

## Perished in the tombs

Downstairs are four tunnels: bread, crown, teardrop, and halo. They smell of decay and moisture.

Tunnel of the crown: five stone coffins, four violated, with sculptures of kings in weird ornaments. One of them holds regalia that looks like it is from the Church of the Weeping Mother. The teenager's body is found lying on the floor. Probably poisoned by one of the poison needles.

Tunnel of the halo: Freestanding coffins are open. Figures look religious, from the Church of the Weeping Mother.

Yewtree carried the boy's body back to his [grieving mother](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md).
