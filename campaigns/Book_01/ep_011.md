## Prologue

The group asks Sigisfarne's priest about [Hackett](../directory/Sigisfarne/Hackett.md).
She does not know who he is and advises treading lightly.
She also seems to think it prudent to send a missive to the priestess of a larger church to send a group to cleanse the ruins under the church as they start to sound possibly cursed.

## The animals

[RushdIbnUbada](../directory/Sigisfarne/RushdIbnUbada.md), [Cai](../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md), [Razvan](../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Mateus](../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) and [Yewtree](../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md) return to the [RuinedChurch](../directory/Sigisfarne/RuinedChurch.md) in [Sigisfarne](../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md)
[Hackett](../directory/Sigisfarne/Hackett.md) receives the requested items and performs a ritual where the adventurers must be naked and wear the heads of different animals.

"
**Dagger-toothed cat**: swift and lithe.  
**Elk**: beautiful, silent, elegant, and strange.  
**Cave bear**: whose power cannot be withstood.  
**Sloth**: rugged, dogged, and stalwart.  
**Sage owl**: whose eyes see all secrets and lies.  
**Mammoth**: with eyes full of understanding.
"

Hackett disregards the [Weeping Mother](../directory/weepingMother/index.md).

Mateus refuses to wear an animal head.
For that, he is claimed by spectral figures of the same animals.
The group returns to the village, and Yewtree prepares a funeral for him.

## A pile of copper

The group decides to go back to the church.
They meet [Arlo](../directory/Sigisfarne/Arlo.md), who goes with them.

Beyond the large circular room lies six rooms - one for each animal.
A final room holds a pile of copper regalia.
The group spends time experimenting with the rooms.
Finally, Yewtree finds a tunnel buried under the pile of copper.

Yewtree and Arlo are picking on each other.

## The miner-mannequins

Following a corridor, the group finds four people paused in time.
They are not dead, but not alive either.
They look like mannequins.
Yewtree prepares them to be taken from here for appropriate burial rituals.

The room also contains a few mining carts and a large sort bin.
Some copper chunks are scattered, but no veins are found on the cave walls.
Beyond the room, the white noise of a river fills the air.
The group finds a wooden rope bridge that crosses the chasm towards a tunnel on the other wall's face.

Yewtree and Rushd briefly explore the tunnel beyond the bridge.
But as they get tired, they spend their remaining strength returning the mannequin bodies.
Hackett allows them to pass with them.

## Epilogue

The priest does not allow the group to bring the mannequins to the Church.
They will stay at Yewtree's house for now.
