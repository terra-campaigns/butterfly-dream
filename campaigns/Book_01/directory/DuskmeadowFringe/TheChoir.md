A traveling flock of crowns that answers questions.
When it speaks, it sounds like countless human
voices in unison, and as a price, it takes something
meaningful from the questioner. Having no true
physical form, it is unable to interact with the
world physically. In case of injury to STR or DEX, it
vanishes or detaches.
