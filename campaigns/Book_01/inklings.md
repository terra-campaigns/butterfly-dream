## Snoozed

- [ ] **Tarot cards once a month**
- [ ] Razzie: Single Gem: You inherited a Single Gem (500gp, cold and brittle) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: squander your newfound riches, and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.
- [ ] Indigo: You were a peddler of fake prophesies, but when one turned out to be true, it drew unwanted attention. Roll on the **Omens** table, but keep the result to yourself.
- [ ] Varg & Gunther: You crossed a creature of the Wood, and it cursed you with a Stone Heart. With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.
- [ ] Fairy Queen's bargains
- [ ] Indigo: You owe a great debt to a member of the nobility and carry their Signet Ring, which serves as proof of their protection as well as your obligation.
- [ ] Tax papers from the monastery were destroyed, but there were copies.
- [ ] Documents make Griffin look as stealing money.
