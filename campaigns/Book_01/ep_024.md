## A new arrival

As the group prepares for another incursion at the [Tyrant's Tomb](../../directory/Kryptwood/TyrantsTomb.md), a visit arrives from the south.
[Farkas](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Farkas.md) is fleeing from the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md).
[Harald](../../directory/Kryptwood/Harald.md), [Gunther](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Gunther.md) and [Varg](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Varg.md) receive him well.
In the morning, they leave [Aelfwin's Estate](../../directory/Kryptwood/AelfwinEstate.md).

## The eastern side of the tomb

The group advances toward the unexplored rooms to the east, protecting [Pastor Noonan](../../directory/Kryptwood/PastorNoonan.md) as they advance.

They find a room where the northern and southern walls are adorned with eight empty obsidian frames.
Glass litters the floor.
One still intact mirror hangs from the eastern wall.
In the mirror, an old man answers questions before it shatters.

To the north room, four Krpytwood hounds fight over a slab of human flesh.
Hunting trophies (taxidermied heads) line the eastern and western walls.
After an explosion of a fine whisky bottle combined with a torch, the hounds attack the group.
They protect the Pastor against them while he conducts his ritual, but Varg and Harald are badly hurt.
The hounds eventually flee to other rooms.

In an ossuary, two former hunters, now just skulls, play charades.
They are Lucius and Severus.

## The ghost of the Tyrant

In the northernmost room, a ghostly crowned figure sits upon an enormous stone sarcophagus.
The sarcophagus is enclosed within a chalk circle.

The ghost explains he is imprisoned here and bored.
He tries to negotiate with the group to set him free, and he would move and take the hounds south.
The group continues their plan, and the Pastor finishes the ritual.
The hounds are now bound to the Tomb.

## The Lords of Hendenburgh

In [Hendenburgh](../../directory/Kryptwood/Hendenburgh.md), the group finds [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) fixing the blacksmith workshop for future use.
They go to the village mansion and speak with the Lady of Hendenburgh.
She is a young wife to the senile Lord.

They both agree to send someone to barricade the entrance of the tombs and put signs of hazard.
Although the Lady does not believe in the stories of the hounds.
