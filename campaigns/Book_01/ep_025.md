## Meeting others

[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md), [Indigo](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Indigo.md) and [Rook](../../directory/Kryptwood/Rook.md) get ready to leave [Aelfwin's Estate](../../directory/Kryptwood/AelfwinEstate.md).
They plan to travel north and find the wall.
It is a cold morning with rain.

Two people meet them on their departure.
[Artea](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Artea.md) and [Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) explain that they met while travelling and faced a lone Hound from the [Tyrant's Tomb](../../directory/Kryptwood/TyrantsTomb.md).

On the first day of travel, going northwest and leaving the [Kryptwood](../../directory/Kryptwood/index.md), they find a giant shoe.
Artea remembers the legends of the druids, about the [Basajauns](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Basajaun.md), who steal women from villages to be their brides.
The group keeps a lookout, afraid that the broken branches are omens of the giant's proximity.

In the afternoon, the giant comes.
It seeks a missing daughter.
In a confused conversation, Rook is hurt by mistake.
Luckily, Ayrrin was close and could help the bonekeeper.

## Tax collection

They sleep at [Hunter's Cabin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HuntersCabin.md), north of the Rabbit's Inn.
Indigo finds a document from Lord Griffin, from the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md), that gives a mercenary named Jock taxing and collecting rights.

The sun shines on the next morning, and the group tries to continue travelling northwest.
Around noon, they arrive at a [canyon](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheCrack.md) that they cannot cross.
The group decides to continue west before turning north.
That night, they sleep under the stars.

The next morning continues sunny, and the group decides to hunt.
Ayrrin and Artea find a deer, but while bringing the game back to the group, Jock sees them.
The tax-collector bullies the two women, and they agree to share half of the game with the mercenary.

Rook explores the area and learns there is no way to avoid the canyon, unless the group ventures to the weird badlands to the west.
The others prepare the meat for rations, and the group decide to rest another night at the same place, before travelling east and taking a mountain pass.

## A forced return march

The following morning starts with intense cold rain, quickly becoming a blizzard.
Indigo sends his magpie tattoo to guide them, and the creature is lost and does not return.
After a day of suffering, they find their way to the Hunter's Cabin again.

As they put logs on the fireplace, Rook finds a [stone](../../gazetteer/Warden-Stone.md) that reminds him of the vision of the wall.
The group consider their options to cross north: the badlands, the east or possibly through the [Quarry](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Quarry.md).
