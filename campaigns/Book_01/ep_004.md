## The fields

The fields of [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) were dying.
The farmer spoke of the ground that swallowed.
He heard skittering sounds flee from him as he retreated.
Four villagers answered: [Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md), [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) and [Hilda](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md).

The fields are barley and wheat.
They are divided by very short stone walls, simple structures meant not to stop people but to divide the land.

Matheus wandered off and claimed to see a masked face.
Bandits in the [Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md), he said.

## A pit in a farm

Sinkhole, eight feet deep.
Cai screamed as she went down.
Razzy floated like a faerie.

Inside, the tunnels had smooth walls shaped by animals.
They smelled of sweetness and rot together.

Some [humanoids](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) find the group.
Beetle-stags with glowing bellies and mole-men with beetle armour and pincer spears. "Everything here is ours," they said.
"I wouldn't advise taking arms against us! I suggest you do exactly as I say if you want to leave here alive!".

A fight ensues.
Razzy was unexpectedly violent.
The molemen sound the alarm, and the party is overwhelmed and starts to flee.
Razzy releases a spell that creates a thicket out of barren stone.


## Why?

Hilda takes one of the unconscious creatures as a prisoner.
The councilmen spoke of omens.
The creature explained that the balance had been disrupted, and the village farms had taken too much forest.
They were here before us, and their fathers knew the people who created the ancient structures.

The creature revealed that they had brought a vendetta upon their heads, which would haunt them no matter where they went.
"When the dark moon comes, the vendetta will begin, and all you can do is pray."

## Downtime

After agreeing to release the creature, vowing never to attack their people again, and abandoning the western farmland to nature, the creature revealed how to undo the vendetta.
They have to win the favour of a faerie monarch, who will intervene on their behalf and put an end to the vendetta.
