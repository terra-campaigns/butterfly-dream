**Notes from Session 2025-04-27**

 Going North along the river
 
 Once we arrive to the site, there is a a large birch-like tree. Seemingly growing out from the trunk itself is a rope going perfectly horizontal stretching past the eye can see to the West.
 
 We make camp at the site. Four shifts: 1st Stone, 2nd Vihero, 3rd Moun, 4th Razzy
 
 On Razzy's shift, the forest starts to come alive with noises - hoots, bird cries, howls. The trees cast shadows in the dim moonlight to make it quite hard to see. From one moment to the next, the sound of ragged, sickly breathing becomes known. Sounds muffled, like coming through wet rags. A deep, sulfuric stench that leaves a strong aftertaste.
 
 A silhouette described what is not there, rather than what is. A low, slight animal-sized humanoid form, moving parallel to the camp.
 
Razzy in fear moves to wake Vihero. The ragged breathing is interrupted, producing a sound akin to a slobbering dog flapping its lips. A slight pause of sniffing the air, and then a sharp, scream of agony.

Razzy pees herself at the scream, pulling her dagger out as she backs up to Stone in a defensive position.

Everyone wakes up.

The creature starts to breath again. About 2-3 zones away from the party. Slow-paced, muffled footsteps. Stone starts to play the happy song on the reed whistle as Moun lights her torch.

The creature pauses for some time. Another sounds of slobbering again before slowly, gradually the sounds of breathing gradually starts to go away.

As time passes, dawn starts to break. The birds start to chirp and things gradually go back to normal. That is except for a vague trail in the position where the creature was that night. The grass is taller, denser, and a darker green colour heading roughly SW to NE.

Stone brings his compass to the rope to test whether it messes with its direction, but nothing of note happens.
