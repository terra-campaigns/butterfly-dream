## Mockeries of death

[Rushd](../directory/Sigisfarne/RushdIbnUbada.md) and [Razzy](../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) go back to the [Ruined Church](../directory/Sigisfarne/RuinedChurch.md) in [Sigisfarne](../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md)
They bring [Cai](../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) and [Mateus](../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) this time.
Quickly they go to the catacombs again.

In the halo room (south), while the group investigates, three skeletons come to life.
Razzy drops one of the standing coffins in one of them, and the group grapple with the remaining two until they are again still.

Cai finds a small brick box, inside the larger of the coffins.
It has the teardrop of the [Weeping Mother](../directory/weepingMother/index.md).
Mateus takes it and puts it in his backpack.

Mateus goes back to the crown room (north).
He loots a small golden circlet and a stone tablet from one of the tombs.

## Small altar small room small gutter

On the teardrop corridor (east), in a small room, the group sees some artistic paintings.
They recognise the symbology but not the stories.
One of them is of a pregnant woman on pilgrimage.
Some areas are covered in soot.

Rushd finds a small hole in the wall \- a missing brick \- behind the small altar.
He calls for Mateus and they see that the newfound brick fits the hole.

The brick shines, and a secret passageway opens to a small gutter.
Cai goes first, and Rushd follows her.

## Hackett, the caretaker

On the other end of the corridor, a longer room hosts small stone tables.
On top of each table is a different animal head.

A creature dressed in a dark robe, with its face covered in shadows, carries a brass-bladed scythe.
The weapon has strange motifs.

The creature introduces itself as Hackett, the caretaker of this holy place.
It taunts the Church of the Weeping Mother and wants payment so he can bless the advancement of the group.

“  
What was worshipped here is forgotten and left to the far reaches of the world  
A meowing babe, an infant of a religion \[Church of the Weeping Mother\]  
You seek the passage  
Be warned, there is old magic  
Fetch me a handful of wheat, fresh water, holly (γκι)  
“
