You live in the grey space between those who have power and those who don’t. You find opportunity where others see only chaos. With nimble fingers, you unburden both the richest merchant and the lowliest guard.

You are rugged with marked skin and wispy hair. You have a sharp face and your speech is gravelly. You are dressed in rancid clothing. You are gregareous but also rude. You are 38 years old. 

What was your last big job?
A bank. (You were caught.) You bear a brand only visible by **firelight**, and anyone who sees **the mark can ask you for a beer.**

What helps you steal? Vagrant’s Veil - 1 charge. Wear it to blend seamlessly into crowds, appearing as a simple pauper.

Bond: You inherited an old Journal, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly written from the journal’s perspective. The writing is crude but accurate.


- Deadly afraid of heights.
- Afraid of ghosts
