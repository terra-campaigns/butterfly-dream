**Greenwise**
How has the Wood failed you?:
You created a restorative tincture that also causes accidental infertility. Take a Healing Potion that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects.

What keeps you safe while in the Wood?:
Briarvine Entangles any creature up to horse size (STR to break free). Reusable.

You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some Silver Moss (petty). Swallow it near water, and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.

Omen: An ancient tree at the heart of a sleepy village has suddenly withered and died, despite showing no signs of disease. After its trunk was cut, a bloody hand was found in its core.

As a young he was sacrificed to The Forest in return for it's mercy. Fortunately The Forest is not a person and does not eat humans by itself. Unfortunately he had no way home and had to survive by himself. When he contacts magical beings he prefers to befriend them. His goal is to understand The Forest.
