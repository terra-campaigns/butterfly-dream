After being interrogated about what they have done in the past, the same teenagers that sent Clive into the ruined church two weeks ago explained they had found a strange cave a few hours down the river.
In this cave, if you walk deep, you find an old structure with black and white tiled floors and walls and defaced statues of men and women larger than life.

The doors are heavy.
Inside are larger-than-life statues of people in noble but strange clothes.
Their faces have been scrapped.
The doric columns smell like dust, and the ceiling is very high and fan-vaulted.

Down the stairs, there is a large floor trap.
The trap leads to a cathedral below.
Above, a massive statue of a very fat person, repugnant and weird.

East and west doors from the cathedral.
They have images of the fat woman from the statue above in different positions.
The doors have some enchantment, but the party cannot open them from the outside.

To the west, a collapsed corridor hides an iron door.
To the east, a long cavern ends in a large pool of water to the northeast.
This is where the insect centaurs went.

The pool becomes deep quickly.
A large iron door (almost a small iron gate) is in this same chamber.
Under inspection, there are no traps, but it is closed, has no handle and does not move with force. 

Checking the south of the tunnel, I noticed that glass mosaics covered some walls, which are now broken.
Red tiles behind mosaics.

The walls are covered in bioluminescent fungi.
In the middle lies a marble statue of a saint.
The group recognise her as one of the [Weeping](../weepingMother/index.md) Sisters.
