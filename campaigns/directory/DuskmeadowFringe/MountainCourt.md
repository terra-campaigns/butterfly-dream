Ancient Crown post in the mountains.
Most of the court is afflicted as beast-bitten, although it is disguised as a cultural aspect.
The Crown hides them, and the local population pretends it is false.
It depends on the Crown, who starts to despise them.

On the full moon, the beast-bitten go to a cavern in the mountain and lock themselves in.
