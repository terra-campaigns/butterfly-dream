Looks like a miniature Sigisfarne.
Built on old ruins but well-maintained monuments.
Two churches, one on each side of the housing area.
Two bridges.

Precise illumination of holy tomes.
Vassals of the [MountainCourt](MountainCourt.md).

Monks are all thin.
Lack of produce.
Waiting for help from Sigisfarne.
