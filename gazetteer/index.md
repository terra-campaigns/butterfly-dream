# The World

**Name of the world**: Known to all as just "the world" or "home".  
**Natural laws**: Just like Earth, with one moon and stars that can be seen, it is round, hot at the equator and cold at the poles.  
**Accessible cosmological locales**: There are several liminal spaces, such as forests, deep caverns and dark oceans. A fast transport network was established through the Iron Gates. Several factions have taken residence in its locations.  
**Global-scale empires**: There are no global-scale empires. Colonisation and commerce between far-away nations can only exist on a small scale.  
**Interconnectivity**: Many transit regions are inhospitable due to weather or hostile entities. The oceans are a treacherous environment, home to alien influences.  
**Global-scale events**: There are no noteworthy large-scale events.
