# The World

![](../imgs/gallery/Pasted%20image%2020250513160040.png)

**Natural laws**: Just like Earth, with one moon and stars visible, it has hot equatorial regions and cold polar regions.  
**Accessible cosmological locales**: There are several liminal spaces, such as forests, deep caverns and dark oceans. A bygone transport network exists through the Iron Gates. Several factions have taken residence in its locations.  
**Global-scale empires**: There are no global-scale empires. Most of the land is wild. Colonisation and commerce between far-away nations can only exist on a small scale.  
**Interconnectivity**: Many transit regions are inhospitable wilderness or hostile settlements. The oceans are a treacherous environment, home to alien influences.  
**Global-scale events**: There are no noteworthy large-scale events.
