Looks like a miniature Sigisfarne.
Built on old ruins but with well-maintained monuments.
Two churches, one on each side of the housing area.
Two bridges to cross the flooded river.

Precise illumination of holy tomes.
Vassals of the [MountainCourt](MountainCourt.md).
Some believe the Court is cursed.

Monks are all thin.
Lack of produce.
Waiting for help from Sigisfarne for food.

The Abbot has a letter from the Crown that allows him to buy out their vassalage for 10 thousand coins.
