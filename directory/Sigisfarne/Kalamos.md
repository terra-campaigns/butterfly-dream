You copy ancient texts and illuminate manuscripts, recording the voices of the clever, the great, and the powerful. You will prove that the pen truly is mightier than the sword.

You have a Statuesque physique, soft skin and filthy hair. Your face is pale, your speech blunt. You have livery clothing. You are cautious and lazy. You are 44 years old.

**Bond:** During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a Letter (petty) sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the Lord Of Winter.
