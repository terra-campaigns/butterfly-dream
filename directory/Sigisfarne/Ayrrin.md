You strike from afar, but that does not make you a coward. You are a musician, the song of your bowstring nought but a warning, singing the silent promise of a quick death.

You have a Scrawny Physique, Weathered Skin, and Braided Hair. Your Face is Sunken, your Speech Formal. You have Filthy Clothing. You are Honorable and Nervous. You are 39 years old.

Your Past
How did you earn your bow? Training. If you are the first to attack, melee attacks against you are impaired until you take STR damage.

What kind of wood is your bow made from? White Ash (d6, bulky). Can be used in place of a shield in melee combat (+1 Armor).
