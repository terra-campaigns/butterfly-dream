You alone can walk among the creatures of the wild, fearless and in control. You share a connection with animals that others can only dream of... so long as you don't become their snack.

You have a Rugged Physique, Rosy Skin, and Luxurious Hair. Your Face is Sunken, your Speech Whispery. You have Soiled Clothing. You are Humble and Vengeful. You are 37 years old.

**Bond:** A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take 20gp, and a strange Compass that always points towards something deep in the Wood.
