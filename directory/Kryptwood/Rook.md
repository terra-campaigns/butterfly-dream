You are a shepherd to the departed. You listen to the final whispers of the dead as they descend into the cold, unyielding earth. You know that to fully celebrate the gift of life, we must honor its finale as well.

You are towering with weathered skin and braided hair. You have a elongated face and your speech is precise. You are dressed in frayed clothing. You are cautious but also bitter. You are 34 years old.

What did you take from the dead?
**A mortal wound from a freed revenant**. You were healed, but the disfigurement has made you a pariah. You require neither air nor sustenance but are still subject to pain and death. Trapped between worlds, the dead see you as one of their own.

What tool was invaluable in your work?
Manacles - Though old, it’s still effective even against the very strong. You don’t have the key.
