Life in Hendenburgh is a constant struggle against the encroachment of the Krpytwood.
Ivy slowly creeps up the walls of the whitewashed cottages while brambles choke even the stately Hendenburgh manor.
Since the arrival of the hounds, a silence has descended upon the village.
Its citizens stay behind locked doors as chickens and geese meander untended through the empty, muddy streets.

## Oliver, the Poacher
#### Stationed at the small barracks for guards
Oliver recently led a large group of townsmen into the forest to put an end to the scourge of the hounds.
Despite heavy losses, they managed to kill three of the dogs.
However, the bodies disappeared after only a few hours.
Oliver is convinced that the pack cannot be eliminated by ordinary means.

## Pastor Noonan
#### Lives at the church of the [Weeping Mother](../weepingMother/index.md)

A bitter ex-priest who has turned to alcohol

## Gregory, the blacksmith

An affable and warm-hearted giant.
Gregory spends much of his time staring longingly across the street at the Galloping Goat Inn.
Recently, Gregory has become the object of the seemingly unjustified ire of the Widow Winstaple and is banned from the inn.

## Widow Winstaple, the Innkeeper
#### Owner of the Galloping Goat Inn

The widowed mother of three strapping sons and proprietress of the humble and welcoming Galloping Goat inn.

## Elizabeth, the Coroner
#### Established a makeshift morgue at the city's boathouse

A recent arrival in the village, summoned to investigate the bodies mauled by the hounds.
