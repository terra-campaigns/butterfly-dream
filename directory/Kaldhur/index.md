hooks:
- The Wall. Cutting through the land, some say the storms cannot cross its heights. It guards against invasion from the forest and escape.
- Yewtree has a map of a supposed great treasure hidden somewhere in a wood north of the Wall.
- Flint the snake charmer of Sigisfarne has a compass that points north, but slightly off. He's been told it doesn't actually point north, but to somewhere in a forest far to the north.
